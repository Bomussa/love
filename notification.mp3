This is a placeholder for the notification sound file.
Since I cannot create actual audio files, please replace this with a short notification sound MP3 file.
You can:
1. Download a free notification sound from freesound.org or similar
2. Use any short beep/notification sound you have
3. The sound should be short (1-2 seconds) and clear

For now, I'll create a workaround using the Web Audio API in the code instead.
